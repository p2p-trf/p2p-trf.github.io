The forum is a student led discussion group for anyone interested in, or currently undertaking research, in technology or technology related issues.

The goal of the group is to create a despecialized yet structured space for conversation about technology-based research through collective and small-group discussion. Our hope is that this space will provide the community base necessary for collaborative projects (ex: developing a panel for a conference, writing a paper, design jams etc), idea incubating (fleshing out your own ideas or research), peer-to-peer support (how do I even use Nvivo? Tableau? Github?), and literature and resource sharing.

## Topics of Interest

If your research, scholarly, or professional interests fall into any of the following (general not exclusive) categories:

- Science and Technology Studies
- Digital Humanities
- Politics of Science and Technology
- Philosophy of Technology
- Technology, Sustainability, and the Environment
- Technology, race and gender
- Public Participation in Science and Technology
- Social and Cultural data science
- Engineering Studies

If you have a side project you are struggling to develop, if you want to connect with other students in the field of technology, if you are investigating technology-related issues and are looking for feedback on thesis/dissertation work, if you want to learn more about STS and start writing in this area, or just looking for more of a peer-led research community, this group is for you.
