Below is a description of the group and its plans. Our first event will be held *November 30th at Harbour Centre, 3:30-6pm (Room TBD)*. The event is informal and welcome to drop-ins, however, [please register on Eventbrite](https://www.eventbrite.ca/e/p2p-tech-research-forum-tickets-52340231040), so we know what kind of snack spread to provide.

## What we will do

We are planning to host a series of events throughout Fall 2018/Spring 2019 with the aim of starting new collaborative projects, or supporting pre-existing ones, in the fields mentioned above. The roadmap for the forum series is as follows (which can be recalibrated based on group needs):

1. _Intro event_:
    Participants present themselves and their research interests
2. _Coagulation session_:
    In this event each participant/group of participants can pitch their research interests/current research and can seek support from the community. The aim is to establish Working Groups.
3. _Design, development and feedback sessions_:
    In these events (2-4 events depending on availability), working groups will share the latest developments and will collect feedback from participants. The aim is to provide groups with support necessary to maintain momentum and help further develop their projects or research goals.
4. _Final presentation event_:
    After the feedback sessions, groups can present the final version of their project to a larger audience. This has potential to feed into events like Media Democracy Day, upcoming conferences, or CMNSâ€™s publishing platform, Stream.

## Come as you are

There are no requirements or demands for group participation as far as readings or background knowledge. All we ask is you attend discussions at the outset prepared to share your own individual background, area of interest or current (or future) research projects and engage in both collective and small group discussion. 

The discussion group is meant to be interdisciplinary, with an aim of fostering dialogue across disciplines and specializations. Please forward to any other departments or individuals you think may have an interest!
